## Introduction

This is a Go implementation of the first part of the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Robert Nystrom.

## Disclaimer

This is project is mainly for learning purposes, the code is my attempt to translate the original
Java code from the book to Golang. I am also not a highly experienced Go programmer, so I am using
this as a good way of learning/practicing a new programming language.
